# Small pre-trained language models

More efficient word embeddings for production classification tasks, with smaller models trained on supervised data & reduced-size conventional pre-trained embeddings.

Based on :
 - FB's [SentEval](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval) for multi-task supervision
 - HuggingFace's [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) for access to pre-trained models
 - [SemEval](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2019/index.php?id=tasks) tasks for transfer evaluation
